# GifTastic

This project demonstrates my knowledge on API's and rendering gifs on the rendered HTML page using jQuery and Javascript. 

## Instructions
1. Search up your favorite animal in the search bar 
2. Click Submit
3. Click the appended button below and your gif will appear. 

You can search as many animals as you want and the buttons will render below so you can go back to your previous search so the gifs are not automatically deleted. 

The gifs will show up to 15 searchs and the ratings are displayed next to it.
